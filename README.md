# awsome_bash_aliases
This file is essentially designed so you can just copy and paste to
## your ~/.bashrc file.
If you have
a suggestion or something needs corrected, let me know.  ~/.bashrc: executed by bash(1) for non-login shells.
Note: PS1 and umask are already set in /etc/profile. You should not  need this unless you want different defaults for root.
